# Intro to JavaScript
01. Which keywords are used to declare a variable in JavaScript?

    > | Let, Var, Const |

02. What is the definition of a function?

    > | subprogram/object designed to do a particular task |

03. What are the `SOLID` principles?

    > | S - single responsibility, O - open closed, L - Liskov substitution,
    I - interface segregation,
    D - dependency inversion |

04. Given this array: How could you remove the `pineapple`?

    ```js
    let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple', 'orange', 'strawberry']
    ```

    > | delete fruit[2] |

05. Given these two objects: How could you add each to the others friends arrays?

    ```js
    let you = {
        name: "You",
        hair: true,
        friends: []
    }
    let them = {
        name: "Them",
        hair: false,
        friends: []
    }
    ```

06. Give an example of a JavaScript `Conditional`:

    > | if(num > 10){
        console.log(Big)
    } else console.log(small)|

07. What is the main difference between `parameters` and `arguments`?

    > | parameters are placeholders and arguments are values
    parameters-(num, num) argument-(2, 3)|

08. Instead of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

    > | style class= debug |

09. What is the difference between a `primitive` value and a `reference` value?

    > | primitive values are simple data like numbers and strings, reference values are more complex like arrays |

10. Demonstrate a loop that prints the numbers between -100 and 100?

    > | for(let i =-100; i <= 100; i++)
    console.log(i) |
